This is a dead-simple mod that provides a landing page designed with flexibility in mind.</p>
It can be used for any game system, but currently has a medieval theme. I am considering creating additional versions for other eras, depending on interest. If you would like to request an additional theme, please open a bug on the github page.
  
This particular version supports 4 players. I am planning additional versions for 5 and 6 players. If you would like a version with another number of players, please open a bug on the github page.

## Setup
Export the two compendiums. One is the landing page scene, and the other is for the journals. The journals include more detailed instructions.

Enjoy!
